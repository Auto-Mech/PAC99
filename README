       			README FOR PAC (readme_pac99.txt)
       
       We are currently using a version of PAC called PAC99.  Some input features will 
       be a little different than those described in the manual, NASA RP-1271, 1992, 
       available from the website: 
  
                http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ 
  
       Also atomic weights, fundamental constants, and some of the examples have been 
       updated.  Please let us know if you have any difficulties.
       
       The FORTRAN source and data are ASCII files in our anonymous FTP server available 
       at the following internet URL:
  
                ftp://ftp.grc.nasa.gov/users/aemc/pac/
                
       The files you should have downloaded are:
       
	       	readme.pac
	       	pac99.f
       		new.groups
       		EFdata.i97
       		exp.i97
       		exp.o97
       		exp.c97
       		exp.e97
       
       The root names of these files are referred to as prefixes. File names have 
       extensions (suffixes) defined as follows: 
       
       		Fortran source programs - .f
       		Input files - .i97
       		General output listing with tables - .o97
       		Coefficients in latest thermo data format - .c97
       		Element data used in calculating the Heats of Formation and LogK - .e97
       
       The ".e97" file will be used only for elements and then only if the option is 
       called for in the ".i97" file.   Coefficients output ".c97" is also an option.
       
       GENERAL INFORMATION TO GET STARTED:
       
       1)  Compile the fortran program pac99.f.  Note that compilers are freely available 
           from the internet.
       2)  Type in the name of the executable.  PAC99 will ask for the name of the 
           input prefix.
       3)  The first input file should the EFdata.i97.  PAC99 will make a binary file 
           unf.EFdata to be used for the Heats of Formation and LogK calculations in the 
           tables.
       4)  The file new.groups must be available for the group additivity option.  It is 
           not a binary file.
       5)  Run the sample problems exp.i97 and check the output files.
       
       To get thermodynamic properties of individual species for the NASA Glenn 
       coefficients database or to download subsets of this data, go to the following 
       URL and see "about ThermoBuild" for details.
